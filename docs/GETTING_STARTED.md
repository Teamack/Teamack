# Getting Started

1. Download your OS build from the latest Release.
2. Create Identity → note your fingerprint.
3. Link another device (QR).
4. Import `sovr-starter-pack.zip`.
5. Post to the Feed; try sending a file to yourself.
6. (Optional) Stand up a Pi relay with `sovr-headless`.

Troubleshooting:
- macOS: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Allow app from identified developer.
- Windows: If SmartScreen warns, click "More info" → "Run anyway" (until we ship a signed cert).
- Linux: `chmod +x SOVR-linux-x64.AppImage` then run.
